Added a check to [`TimeseriesDiscrete.to_continuous_timeseries`][continuous_timeseries.TimeseriesDiscrete.to_continuous_timeseries]
so that the user is aware if the chosen interpolation choice means that the instance's
values at bounds are not actually respected.
The warning can be controlled with the new `warn_if_output_values_at_bounds_could_confuse` and `check_change_func` arguments
to [`TimeseriesDiscrete.to_continuous_timeseries`][continuous_timeseries.TimeseriesDiscrete.to_continuous_timeseries].
