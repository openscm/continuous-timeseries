- Changed the input arguments of [`discrete_to_continuous`][continuous_timeseries.discrete_to_continuous.discrete_to_continuous].
  We have updated so that, rather than taking in a `discrete` argument,
  we take in an `x` and a `y` array and a `name`.
  This API better represents the separation between
  discrete representations, continuous representations
  and the conversion in between them (which is a different thing again).
  All other discrete to continuous conversion functions were updated to match this change in API.
- Changed the input arguments of [`Timeseries.from_arrays`][continuous_timeseries.Timeseries.from_arrays].
  We have updated so that `time_axis_bounds` is now `x` and `values_at_bounds` is now `y`.
  This update reflects the fact that, depending on the interpolation choice,
  the passed in values will not always end up being the values at the bounds.
