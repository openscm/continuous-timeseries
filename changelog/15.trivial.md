- Added checking of scipy's type hinting with [scipy-stubs](https://github.com/jorenham/scipy-stubs) (normally I wouldn't mention this, but this project is so well done I felt it was worth highlighting).
- Bumped the CI mypy check to Python 3.10 to make the most of scipy-stubs (this does run the small risk that our type hints aren't Python 3.9 valid, this is a risk we're willing to take as these type hints don't affect runtime).
- Split the tests into unit and integration tests.
