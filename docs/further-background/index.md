# Further background

This part of the project documentation
focuses on an **understanding-oriented** approach.
In particular, the background of the project
and explanations about its implementation.

We aim to avoid writing instructions or technical descriptions here,
they belong elsewhere.

Points we aim to cover:

- Context and background on the library
- Why it was created
- Connections within this library and between this library and others

## Why did we build this API?

[Why this API][why-this-api] explains why we built this API the way we did.
In particular, the problems that this API solves.
This is a good starting point if you're wondering,
"Why yet another timeseries representation?"

## Representations of objects

See [Representations][representations]
for a discussion of the different ways we represent our objects.
This is particularly useful if you work in IPython/Jupyter notebooks often.
