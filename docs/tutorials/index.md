# Tutorials

This part of the project documentation
focuses on a **learning-oriented** approach.
You'll learn how to get started with the code in this project.

We aim to:

- Help newcomers with getting started
- Teach readers about the library by having them write code
- Inspire confidence through examples that work for everyone, repeatably
- Give readers an immediate sense of achievement
- Show concrete examples without abstractions
- Provide the minimum necessary explanation
- Avoid any distraction

## Continuous timeseries handling

See [Continuous timeseries](tutorials/continuous_timeseries_tutorial)
for an introduction to our handing of continuous timeseries,
i.e. timeseries that are represented by functions
(as opposed to being represented by discrete data points).

## Discrete timeseries handling

See [Discrete timeseries](tutorials/discrete_timeseries_tutorial)
for an introduction to our handing of discrete timeseries,
i.e. timeseries that are represented with discrete data points e.g. arrays.
